## ⚙️ Electric Motor Temperature Prediction using Machine Learning

### 🧾 Overview

This project predicts the **Permanent Magnet (PM) temperature** of an electric motor based on parameters like ambient temperature, coolant temperature, motor speed, voltage, and current.
It helps in **preventive maintenance**, avoiding overheating, and improving the reliability of industrial motors.

### 🧠 Algorithms Used

We trained and compared the following regression algorithms:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

After comparison, the **Decision Tree Regressor** showed the best performance and was selected as the final model.
